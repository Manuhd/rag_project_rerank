# RAG System with Re-ranking

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline with
document ingestion, retrieval, re-ranking, self-correction, and evaluation
metrics. The goal is to improve answer quality by selecting the most relevant
context before generation.

---

## 🔹 Features

- CSV-based document ingestion
- Embedding-based retrieval
- Cross-encoder re-ranking
- Self-correction mechanism
- Token usage tracking
- Ingestion and retrieval metrics
- Structured logging

## ▶️ Run the Project

Step 1: Run Ingestion (One-Time / On Data Change)

Run this only when:

```
py ingest.py
```

Step 2:
```bash
py main.py
```
Step 3:
```
 streamlit run dashboard/streamlit_app.py
```

## 🧠 RAG Pipeline Flow

1. Ingest documents from CSV
2. Generate embeddings
3. Retrieve top-K relevant chunks
4. Re-rank retrieved results
5. Generate final answer
6. Apply self-correction
7. Track metrics and logs
